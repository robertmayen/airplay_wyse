feat: GitOps AirPlay 2 (RAOP2) enablement with nqptp integration

This commit enhances the GitOps repository to fully support AirPlay 2 (RAOP2) with
proper nqptp time synchronization for multi-room audio. The implementation ensures
zero-touch deployment of AirPlay 2 capabilities across the Wyse fleet.

Key changes:
- Enhanced AP2 detection in bin/converge with explicit logging
- Strengthened systemd override to use Requires= for nqptp dependency
- Updated build script with --with-systemd and --with-convolution flags
- Improved health degradation messaging for missing AP2 support
- Comprehensive documentation updates for AP2 deployment workflow

Technical improvements:
- bin/converge: Added verbose logging for shairport-sync version check
- bin/converge: Enhanced health degradation message with actionable guidance
- systemd/overrides: Changed Wants= to Requires= for strict nqptp ordering
- pkg/build-shairport-sync.sh: Added --with-systemd and --with-convolution
- docs/runbook.md: Expanded AP2 section with deployment steps and verification
- README.md: Added dedicated AirPlay 2 Enablement section

The system now automatically:
1. Detects AirPlay 2 capability via shairport-sync -V
2. Enables and starts nqptp.service when present
3. Applies systemd overrides for proper service dependencies
4. Installs attached .deb packages from pkg/ directory
5. Degrades health status with clear remediation steps if AP2 is missing

Verification commands:
- Check AP2: shairport-sync -V | grep -E 'AirPlay 2|RAOP2'
- Check nqptp: systemctl status nqptp
- Check health: bin/health

This ensures production-ready AirPlay 2 support with multi-room synchronization
capabilities while maintaining the least-privilege security model.
