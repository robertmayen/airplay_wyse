Release v0.2.0 - GitOps AP2 enablement (nqptp, overrides, health check)

This release introduces comprehensive AirPlay 2 (RAOP2) support with automated
deployment of nqptp time synchronization and RAOP2-enabled shairport-sync builds.

Highlights:
- Automatic detection of AirPlay 2 capability
- Health degradation when AP2 support is missing
- Systemd override enforcement for nqptp dependencies
- Zero-touch package installation from pkg/ directory
- Enhanced build script for RAOP2-enabled packages

Deployment:
1. Build RAOP2-enabled shairport-sync: pkg/build-shairport-sync.sh
2. Build nqptp if needed: pkg/build-nqptp.sh
3. Attach .deb files to this tag
4. Devices will auto-install and configure on next converge

Verification:
- shairport-sync -V | grep -E 'AirPlay 2|RAOP2'
- systemctl status nqptp
- bin/health

Breaking changes: None
Security model: Unchanged (least-privilege broker model maintained)
